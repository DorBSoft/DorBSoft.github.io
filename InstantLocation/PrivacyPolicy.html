<h1>Privacy Policy for &quot;Instant Location: View &amp; Share&quot;</h1>

<p>At DorBSoft, we respect the privacy of our users and are committed to protecting
their personal information. This Privacy Policy outlines the types of
information we collect and how we use that information.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

<p>We do not collect any personal information from our users of &quot;Instant
Location: View &amp; Share&quot;. We do not require our users to create an
account or provide any personal information to use our app.</p>

<h2>Data Storage</h2>

<p>We do not store any personal information on our servers. We do not collect
device locations on our servers.</p>

<p>&quot;Instant Location: View &amp; Share&quot; accesses your location only
while using the app. This data is cached on your device for a limited time
after locations have been visited. The location data cache is used locally on
your device for better app performance and user experience. This location data
cache is encrypted, and it is not transmitted to our servers.</p>

<h2>DorBSoft location link</h2>

<p>Depending on app settings, &quot;Instant Location: View &amp; Share&quot;
may generate a DorBSoft link when you request to share your location. Clicking
on this link temporarily sends your location to our server to allow your
intended audience to view it. The server processes this information momentarily
and does not retain the location data, nor is it associated with any user
personally or anonymously.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

<p>Firebase Analytics: We use Firebase Analytics to collect <strong>anonymous</strong>
usage data, such as device information and interactions with our application.
This helps us understand how users engage with our app and make necessary
improvements. We do not use Firebase Analytics to collect or store device
locations.</p>

<h2>Crash Reporting</h2>

<p>We collect information about app crashes, which helps us identify and fix
issues. This information is collected anonymously and does not include any
personal information.</p>

<h2>Advertising</h2>

<p>&quot;Instant Location: View &amp; Share&quot; contains advertising, which
may be personalized based on your interests and other information we collect,
as described in our <a href="#Privacy-Choices">Privacy Choices</a> section.</p>

<h2>Privacy Choices</h2>

<p>You may choose to opt out of personalized advertising by adjusting your
device settings or through other mechanisms as may be available on your device.
Please note that opting out of personalized advertising does not mean you will
no longer see ads, but rather that the ads you see may be less relevant to your
interests.</p>

<h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Users should review
this policy periodically for any changes.</p>

<h2>Contact Us</h2>

<p>If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or about
&quot;Instant Location: View &amp; Share&quot;, please contact us at <a
href="mailto:info@dorbsoft.com">info@dorbsoft.com</a>.</p>
